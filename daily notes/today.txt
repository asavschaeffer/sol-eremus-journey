		I am doing some good things today!

to do: 
	Jelly Interaction
	visa application
	HTML certification progress
	work for Cacille




	Yesterday I got distracted and ended up writing a 3,000 word review of
	the currently finalized player-jelly interactions for "Sky Jellies" 
	About half way through spending all day on a task that shouldn't have 
	taken all day because Microsoft Word couldn't satisfy my formatting and 
	structural desires for the document, I came to the realization that
	I could just start writing my Word documents using HTML and CSS. 

	The problems with Word are as follows: 
		- Headings/styles are nightmarish to customize and apply, 
		  especially trying to use them in combination with lists 
		- lists in general holy shit, if I didnt know (shift)+(tab)
		  reduces list indentation level..
		- footnotes do not cooperate with page break in the worst way
		- autosave requires microsoft account HAHA
		- the citation system
		- the image embedding where you want it to experience
		- you can actually link to web files, places in the document,
		  new documents, and email addresses using Word. However, HTML
		  is still better because you can make anything into a link AND
		  its just a minor complaint but it is also so damn strange but 
		  the UI once you open the Insert Hyperlink menu actually uses
		  icons from Microsoft 2007.
	
	Not only can I make lists very comfortably and style them using HTML 
	just after studying for a few days, but I can see that using class="" 
	and css stylesheets I won't need to go to style/headings every time and 
	highlight shit to style it. In the end I can save the rendered web page 
	as a pdf and the only thing I'm worried about is the integrity of the 
	links once I save it as a PDF but there should be a way.
