<!--                         i AM LEARNING HTML!!                           -->


	#more HTML Fundamentals 1:

		)Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
			-open-source network of documentation and tools has 
				information about a wide variety of topics 
				related to web development, including HTML, 
				CSS, and JavaScript.
			-for HTML a given documentation:
				*A definition and demo
				*Attributes
				*Usage notes
				*Examples
				*Accessibility concerns
				*Specifications
				*Browser compatibility
				*Related topics
	%this website uses code embedded similar to how I embed these notes 
	 on my website. They are 700 pixels width, and 178 pixels tall, 
	 adjusting for the width as the browser shape changes.		%



		)<table> element
			-<tr> element adds rows
			- row, use the <td> element.
			- Headings <th> element.
			- colspan attribute & rowspan attribute
			- <thead><tbody><tfoot>

Took a quiz on the tables, then got totally absorbed on redoing the whole
website. I mostly learned CSS from internet resources and got ahead
of myself for the course. However, the website does look a lot better,
and I was able to practice the HTML structure protocols.

Also it must be said that listening to music while coding can work, but
listening to music while learning about coding is pretty distracting for me.
