I am doing some good things today!

	to do: 
		buy detergents
		visa application
		laundry
		HTML certification progress
		work for Cacille


Humanity is so impressive sometimes. The fact that there are these forums where 
expert coders write flawless answers in a foreign language for free..



	Semantic HTML 1.5:

"I’ve never seen nor used a single section tag so far, whereas div is definitely the preferred tag that you’ll probably end up using 99.99% of times.

The use of section and other semantic tags is probably going to play an actual role when SEO ranking is something your blog, website or webapp thrives on.

Just my 2 cents :)" - herebeandre

	<header> & <nav> In this example, we have the <h1> element "Navigation Links", and the <ul> element which contains the links. We wrap the whole thing with the <header> element, and just the links themselves with the <nav> element.

	<div> This can be very useful during times when we need to do advanced styling, such as dividing up <p>, <span>, <img> etc. Think of it like parenthesis for math. It can't hurt to throw them in for organizational purposes, but when you could use a more descriptive bracket always do so.
