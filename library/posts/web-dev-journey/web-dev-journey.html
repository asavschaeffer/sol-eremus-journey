                <h4>My A Dream and B Dream</h4>
                <p>
                  &emsp; When I realized the best way to work in game
                  development is to show that you can make games, I was very far
                  from the world of programming that I was once immersed in as a
                  student. It was nearly midnight in San Francisco and I was
                  helping to close down the restaurant I worked at. If the chef
                  knew I was still there, he would be furious because the
                  management was always cracking down on overtime. But, on the
                  inside, I knew he was proud. He would see that I had been
                  working since 6:00AM when he checked over the books anyway.
                  The task was simple but terrifying: get the trash bins out of
                  the basement. The elevator, like the ovens, drainage,
                  water-heater, lights, roof, and everything else of dire
                  importance in the restaurant would at times betray us. The
                  chapparitos opened up the metal hatch and waited in the alley.
                  The rest of the dish boys and the güero lifted up the garbage
                  bin, pushing it over their heads, and the boys in the alley
                  would pull it through. It would slip, arms would give out, it
                  was not safe. I genuinely would not be surprised if I came
                  into work one morning to find a smashed corpse under a garbage
                  bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &emsp; But nothing worse than trash juice fell on us that day
                  and I headed back to my girlfriend’s house in the ‘loin. She
                  was the pastry chef at the restaurant and she had a lil hijo
                  who loved playing Free Fire. I thought to myself, what a piece
                  of shit rip-off game… and I, for the first time in a long
                  time, I went through the cycle of thoughts that only a person
                  who regrets ignoring their dream feels. At that time, I was
                  happy working at the restaurant, it had a great potential for
                  me. I got the job by randomly running into the owner on the
                  street during winter break of my senior year of college and
                  talking to him about opening a picnic restaurant in a garden.
                  He said it was a thing in China and it had potential in the
                  U.S. too. I had really fucked everything up in college because
                  I liked learning but not working, so I had no job prospects
                  and went all in on being a chef and opening a garden
                  restaurant, “The Slow Coat” somewhere along highway 1. If
                  Sam’s Chowder Bar could be packed every damn time I drove by,
                  so too could my grand ideas bear fruit. I worked at his
                  restaurant for a year, starting at salad, moving to pastry,
                  sides, fry, sarten, and finally my last 3 months private
                  events. They were training me to be the chef, and I really
                  sacrificed everything during that year to the restaurant. I
                  made great friends, dated an inspiring, strong, and beautiful
                  woman, learned what hard work truly is, experienced pressure,
                  witnessed all sorts of Bourdain-esque drama, and build a
                  confidence for myself that I will never lose. Also, I learned
                  how to make a lot of good food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &emsp; The truth is I cannot deny my true dream is to be a
                  hero. I’ve wanted magic powers since I was in the 3rd grade
                  and I realized life was so mundane. In the time between then
                  and now I have gained an appreciation for boring life, and
                  experienced magic through Surfing, learning, and sadhana. Even
                  so, constantly I am filled with inspiration, ideas generated
                  from the strangest things, to put within my other world. I
                  couldn’t sublimate it any longer. It feels like destiny. I
                  can’t stop thinking about it. I want to build another world,
                  that is more than a just video game, where people can
                  experience magic and freedom. And I know if I don’t do it, and
                  somebody else releases a game that captures the world’s
                  attention, I will be a monster of jealousy and regret for the
                  rest of my life. In the end, I dumped her brutally and
                  betrayed the restaurant and gave up the B dream: “The Slow
                  Coast: picnic with 3 stars”

                <h4>Why Web Development?</h4>
                <p>
                  I went on a snowboarding trip with my dad to Japan and ended
                  up staying for 2 months there with a Japanese girl. I hunted
                  hard for a job doing anything in the Tokyo game industry. I
                  applied for so many jobs that recruiters were kindly asking me
                  to stop bothering them with worthless applications. I spent 20
                  hours on a 3D modeling task that I actually think was a
                  masterpiece only to be denied a first interview. I spent
                  thousands on a courses from Udemy, Zenva Academy, Stacksocial,
                  ELVTR, and Codecademy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I failed and went to live with my dad in San Diego because no
                  job no gaijin. I had a nice summer with him, working as a
                  valet with him at the Marriott Marquis. I found a volunteer
                  game design job working for P1, and I got initiated into
                  Shambhavi by Sadhguru at the LA convention center. We went on
                  a surf trip to a little island chain tucked between Nias and
                  the Ments, and I returned to Japan to see my girl and try and
                  work for From Software. I was absorbed again, becoming another
                  drone in the endless depth and breadth of Tokyo. I learned a
                  lot from P1, but it became hard to attend the meetings with
                  the time difference and I’ve ended up putting my volunteer
                  tasks there on the back burner in favor of my grand plan. The
                  best thing I learned from them was references, then portfolio,
                  then experience, skills, certification, or whatever. Truly,
                  the only thing that matters are references. How do we get
                  references? We meet people and show them value. Portfolio
                  based jobs show value via a sample, such as an artist on
                  Artstation, or a musician on youtube. Game Developers have
                  github, and itch.io. Everybody has a personal website. I went
                  to the 2023 Tokyo Game show with no website, just some
                  fraudulent business cards and a dream. I convinced many people
                  I was a researcher and that I could help the design of their
                  game using psychology and neuroscience. Talking to them gave
                  me a lot of energy and drive at the time, and I even was given
                  a pass to the afterparty and the following days by one game
                  studio that I got along with. I organized all the business
                  cards, pamphlets, and scraps into an annotated and color-coded
                  mailing list. I still have yet to message any of them. My
                  website just isn’t ready!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I saw a lot of websites for my colleagues at P1 and even the
                  best game designers had barebones websites. Now, I don’t mean
                  their actual website content. At that time, every last one of
                  them had more game development experience than me. I only mean
                  that if I make a website, from scratch, I can stand out from
                  the rest of the weebly and wix cookie cutter portfolio sites.
                  I will watch the video of the game demo, but it would be
                  better to play it for myself. Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t
                  download random games from portfolio sites. It’s just a hassle
                  to set them up. I realized then that if I have a solid
                  understanding of web development, I can 1) make an excellent
                  website for myself 2) make some side income 3) Make web games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using the website as a game is the best way to show value that
                  I can think of. Any potential connection can look at your
                  site, on their phone, and see if you are up to snuff.
                  Thankfully at least one of my desperate course purchases was
                  useful, and I found a full certification program for “Front
                  End Engineer” on Codecademy. Well, if I have little game dev
                  experience, and no web game, I have to fill my website with
                  something! That’s why I’m writing this blog post!
                </p>
                <h4>My Plan to Fill the Website</h4>
                <p>
                  My plan for the website content is a landing page with
                  impressive artwork and some mission statements. Each has a
                  variety of links to different blog posts describing further
                  the mission statement sub-ideas. At the bottom of the page is
                  a secret link to the web game in the center of a whirlpool.
                  The blog features tons of content, basically whatever I want
                  and lots of stuff aimed toward search engine optimization. For
                  the resume I aim to organize it like a history. At the top I
                  can have a header and a brief description, something like I
                  approach the life as a warrior-priest. Below that are projects
                  and skills. The projects are expandable, and are linked to the
                  skills used. Each skill is a combination of applications and
                  websites, which will be displayed alongside the amount of time
                  I have spent using said application or website. Below that is
                  volunteer experience and education, certifications. The
                  overall organization and structure of this page is still under
                  progress. Would it be better to show certifications with the
                  skills for example or the education section?
                </p>
                <h4>Other Website Ideas</h4>
                <h5>Sol Eremus</h5>
                <p>
                  The secret web game is a way to document all my ideas for Sol
                  Eremus and engage potential connections in a web game. The
                  world is a great ocean, with different islands. As you read
                  the center, the spire with the whirlpool is there, one can
                  sail their boat into the whirlpool or abandon the boat and
                  climb the spire, through many cave levels, to reach the top.
                </p>
                <h5>Skill Match System</h5>
                <p>
                  Companies submit their resume and are returned a list of
                  candidates that best match. Job seekers submit their resume
                  and are returned with job offers.
                </p>
                <h6>Document Reader AI</h6>
                <p>
                  The entries of the database are scraped from the internet far
                  and wide. An AI is trained to identify various skills from a
                  resume or job listing.
                </p>
                <h5>Informed Design Database</h5>
                <p>
                  I also was inspired when at the 2023 Tokyo Game Convention to
                  make a website for some of the Informed Design work I did for
                  Tumblegotchi and Skyjellies. Basically this is a database for
                  anything related to the design of interactive media. I imagine
                  the layout is simple header with the logo, the nav contains
                  [home] [forum] [newsletter] [consulting] [team]. The homepage
                  has a search for research, with some categories like sense
                  (sight, hearing, smell, touch), media type (board game,
                  mobile, console, computer, vr, advertising, café), content
                  type (research, documentation, journalism, post-mortems,
                  etc.), publishing date & more. Below the search bar are the
                  latest and 07:00 - 07:30 UTCmost viewed newsletters, as well
                  as the latest and greatest database entries. Each database
                  entry includes a summary, valuable takeaways, and a field for
                  a person to ask questions and get consultation. The
                  consultation feature, and a custom newsletter catering to your
                  companies needs, are the only paid elements of the website.
                  The free newsletter is on all sorts of topics that can be
                  decided later. Below the main body and before the footer is an
                  inline-block grid of partners, starting with P1, Tiny Forest,
                  William Metcalfe’s crypto company, and hopefully the
                  organization that Garu Sumo developer Ishirasu belongs to.

                  This cascades down, such that if the condition is met the rest
                  are delayed and the results are displayed while the rest keeps
                  searching. For example, search "eye pain", supposing the
                  database has three documents titled “Ocular Strain in Humans
                  by Dr. Froid”, “Health and Nature vol. 13”, and
                  “Neurobiological Effects of Caffeine” on the muscular system".
                  Suppose the keywords for “Health and Nature vol. 13” are:
                  soil, smell, relaxation, trees” but the content contains
                  phrase: “Exposure to the natural light of the sun increases
                  alertness and happiness”. Support the content for
                  “Neurobiological Effects of Caffeine” doesn’t contain the word
                  eye or pain, but the keywords are: focus, anxiety, fear,
                  stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The search entry eye pain misses (1) for all 3 documents
                  because none contain the exact word “eye”, “pain”, or “eye
                  pain”. It catches “Ocular Strain in Humans by Dr. Froid” at
                  (2), and immediately begins loading that as the priority. All
                  documents are analyzed for theme when they are added into the
                  database. In the background, it is indexing and skips (3) &
                  (4) for “Health and Nature vol. 13” and “Neurobiological
                  Effects of Caffeine” because no tags were included in the
                  search. There are no direct matches for keywords in the
                  document, so nothing at (5) It catches “Neurobiological
                  Effects of Caffeine” at (6), because the tags of anxiety,
                  fear, and stress link to the theme of negativity that pain is
                  included in. It adds “Neurobiological Effects of Caffeine” to
                  the loading queue behind “Ocular Strain in Humans by Dr.
                  Froid”, and continues indexing. It skips (7) for “Health and
                  Nature vol. 13 because neither “eye”, “pain” nor “eye pain”
                  were mentioned in the document text. “eye pain” connects to
                  the theme of visual strain, and the sentence “Exposure to the
                  natural light of the sun” connects to the theme as well. At
                  (8), therefore, “Health and Nature vol. 13” is added to the
                  loading queue and eventually rendered.
